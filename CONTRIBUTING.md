# Intro

Hi! Welcome to our project! In this distribution, we are creating our open source blockchain platform. In development, we adhere to two main ideas: universatility and simplicity. 

1. The technology should be as flexible as possible so that it can be easily used in different industries.

2. The technology should be simple enough so that everyone understands the basic principles of work and could use it without reading a ton of documentation.

Our team began development in mid-2017 and is actively developing to this day. Now we have made the platform public/opensource and we invite everyone to join in the development of a universal and simple blockchain platform IZZZIO.

Official Telegram group: [https://t.me/izzzio](https://t.me/izzzio)

Welcome for any descussions and questions!

Do not forget. Creating something new always starts with communication. We welcome any questions (even if they seem silly to you) and treat each participant with respect.

## How to contribute

We recommend starting with a project WIKI [https://github.com/Izzzio/izzzio/wiki](https://github.com/Izzzio/izzzio/wiki).

Also from the [README.md](https://github.com/Izzzio/izzzio/blob/master/README.MD) file.

You can start with both improving documentation or solving [issues](https://github.com/Izzzio/izzzio/issues).

Tasks highlighted specifically for beginners are marked with the label "good first issue". There is several a difficulty marks for tasks:

1. Easy LVL
2. Medium LVL
3. Hard LVL
4. EPIC LVL

Tasks above a simple level usually require additional technology knowledge.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/izzzio/izzzio/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). Please follow our coding conventions (below).

## Coding conventions

We ask you to follow several stylistic rules that will allow you to write clean and understandable code and get great respect from all participants in the project:

* Please do not forget about commenting in English on unobvious sections of the code.
* All JavaScript must adhere to [JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/) with some expections:
1. We always use curly braces in statements, cycles, functions and etc.
2. You can ignore space before a function declaration's parentheses
3. Trailing commas it's ok
4. _We always using semicolons_
* Please! Describe each function or method with JSHint
* This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible. 

Thank you for following these rules.
